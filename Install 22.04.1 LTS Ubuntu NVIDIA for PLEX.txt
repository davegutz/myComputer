HP Omen 15" 2022


#  Get ready
  Phone to approve google requests and usb tethering if needed
  Make space for linux.  Note partition #. (8).  Note any others you want to take over (5)
  Have >4 GB thumbdrive
  On Windows download iso.  flash using balenaEtcher
  Turn off bitlocker all drives
  Deauthorize tools like DVDfab, winxdvd, epubor in case can't get back
  Unplug second monitor, other usb's.  May leave mouse and keypad

# insert iso usb (Ubuntu 24.04.1.iso)
  F1 (rapid F12 on Lenovo laptop, F10 on HP-Omen, ESC on HP-Phoenix, F7 on little_guy) during boot.   Set boot order to USB.  *try or install ubuntu - normal installation - install updates (I tried minimal installation - lots of things didn't work right)
  Choose 'try or install ...'  3 min to next step - may hear music

  # Begin install
     # I had to disconnect the 3TB extra drive in cabinet to get past bitlocker tests.  Reinstall later
     # Fresh clean install
     # basic
     # daveg / pwd   # can change passwords later but note that this initial pwd will be the lock for LUKS file system encryption.  I suggest start with your final password here then temporarily change to a short one for install
     # When done press finish.  It will automatically prompt you to remove media.

  # It should restart to Linux without Bios boot
  # It came up without wifi.  Connect ethernet to grab updates and fix wireless

"So after digging some more on this issue, I believe I managed to fix my issue. The user who originally posted the github article merged it with another article (https://github.com/pop-os/shop/pull/349) where you change the "io.elementary.appcenter-daemon.desktop" to auto-start immediately after logging in, instead of waiting 60 seconds to start. I found this file located in this folder "/etc/xdg/autostart". I then edited the "X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay" entry to a value of "0" and restarted my system. After the restart I opened then closed the Pop Shop and checked the journalctl. I didn't see any of the logs listed above. I will keep an eye on this and update this post with any further details." 


######## Lessons Learned  ##########
- Do not interrupt command-line initiated upgrade.  Will break system.  Let it finish.
- Do not directly upgrade or delete the as-shipped installed python.  Will break system.  Use 'altinstall' make directive
- Always use virtual environment 'venv' unique for each python project.  Allows easy cross-platform 'install' operations in python.
- 'pauvcontrol' default volume on outputs - built-in or pulse audio - is too low to record movies using screencasting.  Set them to 100.
- Use 'ffmpeg -sources pulse' (or 'ffmpeg -sources alsa') to determine screencast source appropriate for the 'ffmpeg'.  Use the long initial string.
- 'grub' changes ordering of boot options upon ugrading kernel.   May be important, especially if you cannot view grub due to bad monitor.
- Acer monitors will not display grub on boot.   Have to learn the grub pattern and perform it blind to get to non-default os e.g. Windows.  Can use a video capture card plus a phone and 'USB Camera' app or capture card plus another PC and 'OBS' to view the new grub pattern.
- New linux os  have Wayland gui system as default.   Breaks a lot of programs.  Resort to Xorg = X11 instead.
- A lot of boot problems can be fixed at end of failed boot using 'Ctrl+Alt+F5' and 'sudo' commands as needed.  Restoring snap applications and snap itself is easy as are desktop managers.
- 'puTTY' is a tried-and-true cross-platform terminal emulator and will save a lot of work if used on your cross-platform applications. 
- 'ffmpeg' is a tried-and-true cross-platform terminal emulator and will save a lot of work if used on your cross-platform applications.
- Python's native 'ffmpeg' is about 4x faster than one installed in the system.
- Ubuntu community is supportive.  I have managed to solve every problem.  Social media in order of helpfulness:  'StackExchange', 'Ubuntu Forums', 'Reddit', 'askUbuntu'.
- Python's built-in UNIX time utilities easier to use than on-line epoch sites.
- GitHub is great way to coordinate cross-platform activities.  Do not track 'dist', 'build', '.idea', '.vscode', 'venv', '...someapp.cpp'.  
- Install settings files in local temp folders for seamless iteration of design changes.  And don't track using GitHub.
- Don't install figures in GitHub.  They're basically unreadable as a historical record.   Some value in keeping them in local machines for reference.  Instead make it easy to reproduce interactive plot tools.
- Do not expect other users to use GitHub.  Either figure out a way to distribute binaries or use GitHub yourself on their computers.
- Do not become dependent on streaming data, e.g. Particle Cloud, Blynk, Google Cloud.  Eventually they will try to charge you.  I am somewhat dependent on Google Cloud for ocamlfuse G-drive application.
- Use Python whenever possible.   'Scilab' and 'Matlab' tools may ALL be replaced by Python and the effort will be worth it.


# get nvidia working
  Settings - System - About shows nvidia recognized
  nvidia-smi # shows always off when using heavy movie playing and screencasting
  sudo apt dist-upgrade
  sudo apt autoremove
  sw and updates - Additional Drivers - apply nouveau drivers - restart - run 15 minutes
                                      - restart - apply nvidia prop tested - restart
                                      - restart - BIOS (ESC) - Advanced - Enhanced(?) - Integrated Video
  Not sure any of this helped
  lspci -vnnn | perl -lne 'print if /^\d+\:.+(\[\S+\:\S+\])/' | grep VGA
    Your output will be something like that:
    00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller [8086:0166] (rev 09) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller]) 
    01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Chelsea LP [Radeon HD 7730M] [1002:682f] (rev ff) (prog-if ff)
    Now look for the [VGA controller] at the end of each device. Whichever device has it, is the active GPU. In my case it's the i7 processor (HD 4000) that's handling the work.
  mine is working.  It may have been all along
