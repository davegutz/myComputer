# NOTE:  if end up at grub> command due to crash, type 'exit' to boot into Windows

# NOTE: if first 

 starts Windows instead, re-open BIOS - boot.  At bottom is a strangely worded option. Go in there and you should be able to move Ubuntu to the top.


  sudo apt install os-prober
  sudo os-prober
  # grab the output:  /dev/nvme0n1p1@/efi/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi
  sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt

  sudo su
  cp -R /mnt/efi/Microsoft /boot/efi/Microsoft
  ctrl-d to exit
  
  sudo nano /boot/efi/loader/loader.conf
  add 'timeout 8' to this file
  
  reboot.  change order so Pop-OS is at the top.  Save & exit
  


To enable the Grub boot menu in a Pop!_OS dual-boot setup, ensure the
os-prober utility is installed and then run sudo update-grub to detect other operating systems like Windows. Then, modify your EFI bootloader's configuration to set a timeout for the menu to appear before booting into the default OS. You can access the boot menu during startup by pressing a designated key (often F12 or ESC) to choose your operating system.
