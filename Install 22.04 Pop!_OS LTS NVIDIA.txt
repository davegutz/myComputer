HP Omen 15" 2022

# This already had Ubuntu dual boot installed.   See "Install 24.04 Ubuntu".  Pop!_OS (popos) is Ubuntu clone.  It doesn't have 'snapd' installed by default.  Once that is installed, installation is similar to Ubuntu.  Pycharm-community did not work right so had to download and create shortcut.  x11/ Xorg is installed by default.

# insert iso usb
  F1 (rapid F12 on Lenovo laptop, F10 on HP-Omen, F7 on little_guy) during boot.   Set boot order to USB.  *try or install ubuntu - normal installation - install updates (I tried minimal installation - lots of things didn't work right)
  Choose 'try or install Ubuntu.'  3 min to next step - will hear music

sudo apt-get update

IMPORTANT: This PPA contains release candidate and development versions of other packages which may break your system. It is strongly recommended that you limit the PPA to only installing/upgrading the corectrl package to avoid such issues. According to the official installation instructions, create the file

nano /etc/apt/preferences.d/corectrl

# Never prefer packages from the ernstp repository
Package: * Pin: release o=LP-PPA-ernstp-mesarc 
Pin-Priority: 1 

# Allow upgrading only corectrl from LP-PPA-ernstp-mesarc 
Package: corectrl

sudo nano /etc/xdg/autostart/io.elementary.appcenter-daemon.desktop 
change 60->0
"So after digging some more on this issue, I believe I managed to fix my issue. The user who originally posted the github article merged it with another article (https://github.com/pop-os/shop/pull/349) where you change the "io.elementary.appcenter-daemon.desktop" to auto-start immediately after logging in, instead of waiting 60 seconds to start. I found this file located in this folder "/etc/xdg/autostart". I then edited the "X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay" entry to a value of "0" and restarted my system. After the restart I opened then closed the Pop Shop and checked the journalctl. I didn't see any of the logs listed above. I will keep an eye on this and update this post with any further details." 

### Failed keep screencasting lid closed
# Gnome extensions (espresso) to keep awake during screencasting
  sudo apt install gnome-shell-extensions
  logout / in
  sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-manager
  logout / in
  Seems to work!  Can close lid with occassional mouse movement (need to change screecast activity setting?).  But it blanks the recorded screen.
  uninstall
